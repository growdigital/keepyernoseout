# About Groundwork

## Simple

Groundwork is **very simple**. A blog template for [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), a JavaScript [Static Site Generator](https://www.staticgen.com/), built to write modular CSS and JavaScript, designed for web designers that code.

## Ambitious

Groundwork is **ambitious**. It wants to be:

1. Simple static site for web designers, with the minimum of coding.
2. A one-stop-shop for [**independent publishing**](https://indieweb.org/).
3. Easy to create content with a graphical <acronym title="User Interface">UI</acronym> and mobile image posting.

To help out with new features, contact Jake on <mailto:contact@groundwork.rocks>

Built with pride by [Jake Rayson](https://www.growdigital.org/) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º frontend developer and forest gardener.
